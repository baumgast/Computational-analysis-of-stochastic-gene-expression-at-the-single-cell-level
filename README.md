# Computational analysis of stochastic gene expression at the single-cell level

Teaching material as starting point for students of the 2019 systems biology summer school at the Center for Systems Biology Dresden. The idea is to use a simple MCMC method to calibrate the mean and variance of a stochastic model of gene expression to yeast single cell transcription data.

## Methods taught

* Stochastic simulations with the SSA or Gillespie algorithm
* Whats a master equation and how can we use it for stochastic modelling
* Deriving moment equations (mean and variance) from the master equation
* Analysing single cell transcription time course data and how to compare to simulations
* Basics of Bayesian statistics
* The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and how to use it to fit models to data
* Analysing the Posterior parameter distributions
